            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://erdfisch.de">Where I work</a>, we have just initiated Wednesday afternoon
team-time sessions, where we can work on projects outside of our day-to-day
work.</p>

<p>The idea started out as "team-time" but now we call it "tea-time" because that's
more fun.</p>

<p>So, here are a few notes from my first teatime:</p>

<p>I'm a back-end developer who has, in the past, done as much as possible to avoid
Drupal theming.</p>

<p>So teatime was a good chance for me to ask our in-house theming guru Pascal
stupid questions :)</p>

<p>We're looking at ways in D7 and D8 to easily get data into html. In D7 this
traditionally means page manager, panels and display suite. We've been working
on ways to make this easier using a new approach, called "seem". More about this
to come.</p>

<p>After teatime I watched this:</p>

<p><a href="https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/aha-understanding-and-using-render-arrays-drupal-8">Aha! Understanding and Using Render Arrays in Drupal 8</a></p>

<p>... a great talk from yesterday at DrupalCon New Orleans ...</p>

<p>... that led me into this massive and very interested issue about the future of
the render and theme system ...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2702061">Unify &amp; simplify render &amp; theme system: component-based rendering (enables pattern library, style guides, interface previews, client-side re-rendering)</a></p>

<p>It's a great read in itself. The issue summary includes this awesome quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>understanding the entire flow is nearly impossible, and probably rivals the
  complexity of some simpler biological organisms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The discussion here is long and complicated but worth reading, because it is
conducted in a very constructive way. I think this is due to the masterful way
Wim Leers manages and frames the discussion.</p>

<p>There's a comment there about using twig in <a href="http://sculpin.io">sculpin</a> - that
led me down the route of checking out sculpin and starting this blog.</p>
